                    When you submit a message or a comment, its metadata is
                    retained until (if) you tell us to remove it. We use this
                    data so that we can recognize you and approve your comments
                    automatically instead of holding them for moderation.<br
                    />If you register on our website, we also store the personal

                    We use the SSL/HTTPS protocol throughout our site. This
                    encrypts our user communications with the servers so that
                    personally identifiable information is not captured/hijacked
                    by third parties without authorization.<br />In case of a
                    data breach, system administrators will immediately take all
                    needed steps to ensure system integrity, will contact
                    affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if
                    needed.<br /><br />

                    legal, or security purposes. In short, we cannot erase data
                    that is vital to you being an active customer (i.e. basic
                    account information like an email address).<br />If you wish
