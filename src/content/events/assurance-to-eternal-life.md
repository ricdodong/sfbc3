## If you died today, Are you 100% sure you would be in heaven?
### Here’s How You Can Know!
1 John 5:13
“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life…”

#### First, you must realize that God’s Word says we
are all sinners and our sin has separated us from a Holy God.
Romans 6:23a
“For the wages (payment) of sin is death…”

#### This death is described in the Bible as the second death or the lake of fire; eternal separation from God.
Revelation 20:14,15
“And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”

#### If we pay what we owe as sinners, we must spend an eternity in the lake of fire.
Revelation 21:8
“But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murders, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”

Yes, the Bible teaches that there is an eternal lake of fire where religious, as well as ungodly, sinners go who find no way of paying the penalty of their sin.
No imperfect sinner can pay his own sin debt because God demands a perfect sacrifice for sin.
#### You must realize that as a sinner you owe a penalty.
Romans 3:23
“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

Romans 3:10
“As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one.”

#### No one is perfect. No one has lived up to God’s perfect standard. (James 2:10)
Isaiah 59:2
“But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you…”

#### You must realize that Jesus Christ, God’s perfect sacrifice, has already paid our sin debt.
Romans 5:8
“But God commendeth (proved) his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”

2 Corinthians 5:21
“For he hath made him to be sin, for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”

John 3:16
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

1 Peter 3:18a
“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God…”

When Jesus died on the cross, He paid for all of our sins and bridged the gap that separated us from God.

#### You must realize that Jesus Christ was not a sinner and that God took all of our sins and placed them on Jesus at the cross.
 While Jesus was bearing all of our sins in His own body, God punished Him in our place to pay the sin debt that we owe. Jesus became our substitute. Praise the Lord!

#### You must receive by faith the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Saviour and what He did for you at Calvary on the cross.

John 1:12a
“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God…”

Romans 6:23b
“…but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

Romans 10:9-10
“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”

Romans 10:13
“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

The word “BELIEVE” means to trust, to depend on Him. To believe the Lord Jesus Christ means that you accept the following facts:
That you are a sinner;

#### That as a sinner, you owe a debt sin;

That Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His precious blood to pay for the sin you owe; and that after three days and three nights, He arose bodily and victoriously, conquering sin and death and hell. To believe means going beyond mere intellectual assent. It means to place your faith totally in Him; plus nothing and minus nothing; forever to save you from hell, forgive you of your sins, and give you the gift of eternal life.

#### Most importantly, when you completely trust Him to get you to heaven, it will be forever settled, once and for all.

Now that you’ve done reading this, why not trust Jesus and pray a simple prayer from the heart? If it is okay with you, please pray this prayer below:


Dear God in heaven, 

I came to You in the name of Jesus Crist. I now realize I am a sinner and deserve to pay for my sin. I believe that Your only begotten Son “Jesus Christ” became my substitute on the cross, paying the sin debt I owe and that His shed blood, death, burial, and bodily resurrection from the grave were for me.

I believe in You and now receive You with all my heart and put my faith 100% totally in You alone as my Lord and Personal Saviour. I now trust You to forgive me of all my sins and cleanse me with Your precious blood. Please save me from hell, and give me the wonderful gift of eternal life. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for saving me and making me Your child. Amen.
If you have prayed and asked the Lord Jesus Christ to save you, if it’s okay with you, please let us know so that we may rejoice with you! We would also like to be able to talk to you about how to live a Christian life. May God bless you in your new life in Him
